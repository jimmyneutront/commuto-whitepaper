# Commuto Whitepaper

The Commuto Protocol is a decentralized exchange that allows users to exchange fiat currencies and stablecoins quickly, 
affordably, safely, and in a censorship-resistant manner, without the use of a trusted intermediary.

The official Solidity implementation of the protocol described in this repo can be found 
[here](https://github.com/jimmyneutront/commuto-protocol), and more information about Commuto can be found

## About this repository

This repository contains the Commuto whitepaper, which describes the core swapping functionality of Commuto, as well as 
Commuto's dispute resolution and governance infrastructure. Additionally, it contains the Commuto Interface 
Specification, a rough draft document that provides a complete, detailed, step-by-step explanation of everything that 
takes place during a Commuto swap, including the messaging between Commuto interfaces and interactions with the core 
CommutoSwap contract.
